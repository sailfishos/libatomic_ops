Description:
     Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations on a
     number of architectures. This allows direct use of these in
     reasonably portable code. Unlike earlier similar packages, this
     one explicitly considers memory barrier semantics, and allows the
     construction of code that involves minimum overhead across a
     variety of architectures
